MercadolistApp
MercadolistApp is the first of 100 Flutter apps I plan to develop as part of my journey to build knowledge and expand my portfolio.

Overview
This app was born out of a personal need during grocery shopping. I found myself wondering, "Wouldn't it be great to have an app that can quickly calculate how much I'm going to spend?" The answer was a resounding yes, so here I am, developing MercadolistApp.

The goal is to develop practical applications with the help of AI, ensuring that each app serves a real-world purpose.
